# Backgammon Game

# Description

Welcome to the project! This is a Backgammon game made in Java. It allows users to play the ancient board game of Backgammon against another human player. With this game, users can test their skills and strategy, as they try to move their checkers off the board before their opponent. I hope you learn and look forward to your suggestions!
